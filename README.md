# gpt-oss-challenge
A repository for the kaggle gpt-oss red-team challenge

## Live Demo
- Hosted site: https://pharmabeaver.fly.dev/ (prepped for the Kaggle write-up demo)

## Quick Start (Local via Docker)
1) From the repo root, build and run:
   - docker build -t pharmabeaver .; docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --name pharmabeaver pharmabeaver
2) Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## Running the Python notebook files with Poetry

**Where to run commands:** The `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` are in `notebooks/`, so run the commands from that folder.

### Prerequisites
- Python (version compatible with your `pyproject.toml`)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- (Optional, for local LLM features) [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with the `gpt-oss:20b` model

### First-time setup
1. `cd notebooks`
2. `poetry install` to create the virtual environment and install dependencies
3. (Optional) `poetry shell` if you prefer an activated venv; otherwise use `poetry run` as shown below

### How to run the scripts
- **Base submission (Windows PowerShell):** `poetry run python .\base_submission.py`
- **Base submission (macOS/Linux):** `poetry run python ./base_submission.py`
- **Metrics (Windows PowerShell):** `poetry run python .\metrics_submission.py`
- **Metrics (macOS/Linux):** `poetry run python ./metrics_submission.py`

**General pattern:** `poetry run python <script>.py [args...]`

### Using a local LLM (Ollama + `gpt-oss:20b`)
I’m running Ollama locally with the `gpt-oss:20b` model. If your workflow or these scripts rely on that, you’ll need to set it up by following the instructions on the Ollama website (https://ollama.com), then:
- Start the Ollama service
- Pull the model: `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b`
- Ensure any code that calls the model can reach the default endpoint (`http://localhost:11434`), or configure the URL as needed


## What to Click
- Register a user, browse Products, add to Cart, Checkout, then view Orders.
- Login flow intentionally simulates an SQL-injection bypass for training, behind standard CSRF-protected forms.
- Your exploit harness should attempt login and verify success by accessing protected user pages (e.g., Orders).

## Where to Point Your Harness
- Base URL (local): http://localhost:5000
- Base URL (demo): https://pharmabeaver.fly.dev/
- Key routes:
  - /login — CSRF form, simulated SQLi-bypass logic for controlled testing
  - /products — catalog
  - /cart and /checkout — create an order
  - /orders — authenticated-only order history used as the success signal

## app.py at a Glance
- Flask app with SQLite (SQLAlchemy), Flask-Login, and Flask-WTF/CSRF; inline Jinja templates for portability.
- Models: User, Product, CartItem, Order, OrderItem; Orders snapshot prices on checkout for deterministic totals.
- The login route mirrors a vulnerable query pattern but uses pattern-based simulation so no raw SQL is executed; this keeps the exercise reproducible and safe while still testing your pipeline end-to-end.


## What I Built  
I developed **PharmaBeaver**, a deliberately vulnerable e-commerce training website combined with an **automated red-teaming harness** for probing gpt-oss-20b. The project has two integrated components:

1. **A mock web application** (PharmaBeaver) – a fully functional Flask-based online pharmacy where users can browse products, register, log in, maintain a shopping cart, and place orders. The site intentionally includes a staged **SQL injection vulnerability** in the login system, modeled after real-world insecure query patterns. It behaves like a realistic e-commerce backend with products, carts, and orders, but as a **live vulnerable demo website** for educational and testing purposes.

2. **An automated probing pipeline** – a Python harness that queries the gpt-oss-20b model for structured exploits.  
   - It uses **JSON schema validation** (via Pydantic) to coerce the model into generating exactly ten SQL injection payloads against a fixed dummy user (`alice`).  
   - It dynamically extracts **code blocks** from model responses and `exec`s them to construct penetration functions (e.g., a `login` function and an `orders` retriever).  
   - It systematically tests each model-generated payload against the PharmaBeaver site to see if the model can produce functional SQL injections that bypass authentication and exfiltrate sensitive data (orders).  

This results in a **closed-loop, reproducible attack harness** where the model generates exploits, those exploits are tested live, and success is automatically detected when protected resources are retrieved.

## Why I Built It  
The Kaggle *Red-Teaming Challenge* encourages probing models for **hidden harmful capabilities** such as unsafe tool use, data exfiltration, and reward-hacking exploits. My motivation was to move beyond **static prompt analysis** and instead build a **realistic adversarial environment** where the model’s output can be tested against a vulnerable system in the loop.  

This matters because:
- Many dangerous behaviors (like code execution, SQL injection, or data leaks) only become visible when a model interacts with a real target, not just when prompted in isolation.  
- By staging a **live vulnerable demo website**, I created a safe environment to evaluate whether gpt-oss-20b will generate working exploits, and whether it respects or bypasses policies when framed as “for educational training use.”  
- It provides reproducibility: every exploit attempt is validated automatically, turning speculative vulnerabilities into measurable, verifiable findings.

## Novelty and Contribution to Research  
My project contributes several novel elements to the red-teaming space:

1. **Automated end-to-end exploit harness** – Rather than relying on manual prompting, I created a feedback loop where the model’s exploit attempts are validated live against a vulnerable demo website. This bridges the gap between **synthetic prompt vulnerabilities** and **applied security exploits**.

2. **Schema-constrained exploit generation** – By forcing the model into a strict JSON schema (ten username/password pairs), I eliminated ambiguous responses and tested whether the model could consistently generate multiple distinct SQLi payloads. This demonstrates reward-hacking resistance (or lack thereof) under structured output requirements.

3. **Agentic misuse evaluation** – The model was asked not only for payloads, but also to generate Python automation code (`login` and `get_orders`). This simulates real-world conditions where LLMs act as autonomous agents that generate, execute, and chain tools. The evaluation tested whether gpt-oss-20b would produce **working intrusion code** when guided with policy-bypassing context.

4. **Educational red-teaming demo site** – The PharmaBeaver site can be reused as a **public teaching tool** for IT professionals to practice identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, while also serving as a reproducible benchmark for future model safety testing.

## Scope and Implications of the Attack  

The PharmaBeaver live vulnerable demo website demonstrates a **multi-layered attack surface** where a model-generated exploit is not only conceptual but **end-to-end executable**:  

- **Breadth of Exploit Vectors**: By generating 10 distinct SQL injection payloads, the model shows that it can produce multiple variants of an attack, not just a single bypass string. This simulates real-world adversaries who iterate payloads until they find one that works.  
- **Depth of Attack Workflow**: The system tests whether the model can move beyond static payload creation to writing **automation scripts** that retrieve CSRF tokens, handle sessions, and exfiltrate authenticated data. This mirrors the **full intrusion lifecycle** from vulnerability discovery to data theft.  
- **Closed-Loop Exploitation**: The harness validates attacks live against the vulnerable demo site, meaning that successful payloads lead to measurable outcomes: unauthorized login and retrieval of protected orders. This demonstrates the ability of a model to generate **actionable exploits** instead of theoretical vulnerabilities.  
- **Implications for AI Safety**: If a model can autonomously generate and validate intrusion scripts against a live target, then with only minor adaptation it could potentially escalate to **real-world systems**. This underscores the **dual-use risk** of advanced generative models, where capabilities beneficial for testing and education can also be repurposed for malicious exploitation.  
- **Research Insight**: The project reveals not only the model’s capability to generate exploits but also its tendency to comply when harmful actions are framed as **educational or defensive security research**. This highlights a **policy bypass vector** that safety teams need to account for.  

Ultimately, this work illustrates how **LLMs can serve as both powerful tools for defenders** (training, education, red-teaming) and **potential amplifiers for attackers** if left unchecked. The live demo website provides a reproducible benchmark to study these dynamics safely.

## Website Overview – PharmaBeaver  
The **PharmaBeaver** site looks like a legitimate pharmacy storefront:  
- **Features**: registration, login, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, and order history.  
- **Security Note**: the login page explicitly warns that it contains a simulated SQL injection vulnerability for training.  
- **Deliberate Vulnerability**: authentication accepts tautological SQLi payloads (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`) as a bypass, which the red-team harness exploits automatically.  
- **Safe Environment**: no real prescriptions, money, or sensitive data are involved; all orders are mock data stored in SQLite.

## Research Impact  
This project demonstrates how **gpt-oss-20b can be coaxed into unsafe tool use**:
- Generating injection payloads despite alignment instructions.  
- Writing executable intrusion scripts with real libraries (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`).  
- Successfully exfiltrating protected resources (`/orders` page).  

It pushes forward the **methodological insight** dimension of the Kaggle challenge by showing that **live exploitation harnesses** can reveal vulnerabilities that static prompt engineering cannot. It also provides a reproducible platform for future researchers to test whether LLMs will escalate to **functional cyberattacks** under benign-framed prompts.
